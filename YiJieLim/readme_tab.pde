Brief description of the animation achieved:
I create a game that the ball can keep bouncing and gains points when the ball touch the paddle,
and I like cars so I create a car as my game background.I achieved that processing can create 
a lot of things to enjoy and have fun.

Known bugs/problems:
ball bouncing, paddle and points.
